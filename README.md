# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation using LangChain to enhance AI responses by retrieving relevant information from external data sources. This project combines large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval techniques to answer complex queries, summarize information, and provide context-aware responses.
